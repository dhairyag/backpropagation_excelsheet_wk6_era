## Overview of the Neural Network:

- Input Layer: There are two input features, labeled as i1 and i2 nodes.
- Hidden Layer: The hidden layer has two neurons labeled as h1 and h2. The connections between the input and hidden layers have associated weights w1, w2, w3 and w4.
- Output Layer: Two output nodes are o1 and o2, showing the predicted values. The weights from the hidden layer to the output layer are labeled w5, w6, w7 and w8.
- Activation Functions: The hidden and output layers use sigmoid as activation function, as indicated by the sigma symbol.
- Errors: The outputs have errors E1 and E2 which are calculated with the help of predicted (o1, o2) and target (t1, t2) values, which are part of the total error E_Total.
